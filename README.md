# culinaree

this project is the first one i have created after learning javascript.
The purpose was to use the spoonacular api to create a recipe website to help me understand the following:
  DOM manipulation;
  APi requests
  es6 features such as async and await.
  responsive design with media queries
  and how to implement a so called pagination.
